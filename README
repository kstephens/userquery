= UserQuery

This is the rubyforge.com UserQuery package.

== Installation

gem install userquery

== For User Documentation, see

http://rubyforge.org/projects/userquery/

The RubyForge package userquery allows users to do general queries on SQL database table columns using a simple query language. The package parses tokens from the user's query and generates SQL WHERE clauses immune to SQL injection attacks.

For example, if a user wants to search for all entries records on a DATETIME field named date, the user can enter: "11/1/2006" into a text field associated with searching on the date column.

UserQuery will intuitively convert this query into an SQL WHERE clause fragment:

    (
      (entries.date >= '2006-11-01 00:00:00') 
    AND 
      (entries.date <  '2006-11-02 00:00:00')
    )

The user query syntax includes "NOT", "OR", "AND" operators, grouping with parentheses, well as relational operators like "LESS THAN 5" or ">= $500". Keyword searching, like "foo AND NOT 'bar baz'" using SQL LIKE operators is configurable.This package deals with currencies, conversions between currencies and monetary values in an object-oriented fashion.
